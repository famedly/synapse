      # break down into a docker tag of "v1.234.5" and "v1.234.5_6". As the suffix is incremented
      # in future builds, this will make the base build sha change  and can potentially trigger
      # "updated image" notifications(or some such) for the general public that would
      # not actually have tangible updates.
